Because your office is designed for people who employ people they don't trust. For people who work because "the man" who pays them is watching them. It keeps them busy, doing the wrong thing, and there was no choice

Move beyond that. Leave the office, create your own space and do it for love AND money. Abandon your commute and spend that time on a passion. Passion you'd forgot you had.

And with your life returned, you're free and safe to connect. Our writing, our voice, our video makes real work possible. And we can be vulnerable and learn and care about our creation. And care about the people's lives we are creating for and with. Because we chose to work that way
