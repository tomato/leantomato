title: User Stories for Remote Collaboration 
---

I've been collaborating remotely with my team for 5 years and we try to be at least as effective and hopefully more effective than a collocated team. The tools are getting better but none have really proved a joy to use yet and no single tool seems to do it all. Here's my initial user stories if you fancy building one. I'll try and update this as I learn more. Please feel free to share your own stories in the comments.

So that I know who I can work with  
I want to know who is free  
And then invite them to work with me

So that I know what's going on around me  
I want to be able to see who is talking to who, and the topic they are talking about, if they choose to share that  
I want to be able to join that conversation if it looks useful and I have time  
I want to be able to see what other people are working on  

So that I can get help   
I want to be able to ask if anyone on the team or organisation can help me with a problem  
And if someone does, I want to start a separate conversation with them  
And other people can see that conversation if they want to, but they shouldn't be disturbed by it  
And I want to be able add voice and/or video to that conversation  

So that I can talk to multiple people  
I want to have multiple text conversations going at once  
And I don't want to lose them in lost windows  

So that I can concentrate   
I want to be able mute any or all text conversations  
And I want to be able to see if those conversations have been updated when I've finished what I'm doing  

So that I can stay up to date on important issues  
I want to be notified immediately when certain text conversations are updated  
Or anybody starts a new text conversation with me

So that I can go and get a coffee  
I want it to be really obvious that someone is trying to contact me when I get back  

So that I can pair program  
I want to be able to be able to see my pair's screen  
I want to be able to quickly swap between driver and navigator  
I want to be able to use voice and sometimes see video  
I want to be able to send links to my pair  
And I want to be able to do this 8 hours a day without any dropped connections  

So that I can get more help when we are all pairing  
I want to be able to add another pair easily to our session  
When we have finished I want to be able to go back to my original conversation  

So that I can stay sane   
I want a place for social chat  

Because my brain is a sieve and I forget to take notes  
I would like voice conversations to be transcribed
