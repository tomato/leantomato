Change won't happen in your office, because nothing important really happens in offices. Just churn and manipulation, negotiation and politics, despondency and degradation and defence of the status-quo.

Don't drown in it

Send the workers home to be people again. Together create a community online. Let people talk and values emerge. Expose assumptions, find truth and shed fear. See clearly, build, teach and sell. Stop excusing yourself.

Yes, in time people may take power and build hierarchy. The creativity will drain away, a waste of life.

And when it stops being real, stop and start again. Revolt.
