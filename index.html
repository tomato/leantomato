    <div class="container questions">
      <h2>Why Work From Home?</h2>
      <p class="important answer">So you can take away the commute, the politics and the hierarchy, and leave the team to work together, focused on their purpose.
      <h3 class="question">How can the we collaborate if we are miles apart?</h3>
      <p class="answer">The internet is built for collaborations, we talk, video, share screens, use chat rooms. There is no need to be physically co-located anymore, many developers collaborate better when they aren't.</p>
      <h3 class="question">How can I see what's happening? Won't I lose control?</h3>
      <p class="answer">In return for autonomy, it becomes everyones on the team responsibility to be visible, and be available to help. Everyday the whole team meets online to share where they are and together decide what's next and help each other remove anything blocking the flow.</p>
      <h3 class="question">I can't even find the developers I need, let alone trust them to work from home</h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Somehwere in the country, continent, planet, is the person you dream of, offer them the ability to work, with autonomy and purpose and he'll biting your arm off to come and work for you... This take staff liquidity to a new level.

      <h2>So What's The Plan?</h2>
      <p>It depends on how you are working right now, but an example might be:
      <ol>
        <li>2-day workshop: Where are we? What is helping and hindering us? Is what we do visible? What do we need to learn? How can we learn more effectively?
        <li>Lets Get Started: A period of starting from home, where Lean Tomato are working with to help getting this new way of work established
        <li>Keep Improving: We pop back form time to time to see how you are improving and offer help with any problems you are encountering
