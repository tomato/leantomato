        <h2>Building Heathy Software Development Teams...<br/>...who work from home</h2>
        <p>At <span class="logo">LeanTomato</span> we open up your <strong>development process</strong>, rooting out the blocks and discovering flow through <strong>visualisation and collaboration</strong>. We help build a team of <strong>autonomous, competent and purposeful developers</strong> and then we send them home, to find their <strong>creativity</strong>, free from the anxiety of office life.

    <div class="container questions">
      <h2>Why Work From Home?</h2>
      <p class="important answer">Because you can take away the commute, the politics and the hierarchy, and leave the team to work together, focused on their purpose.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="question">How can the we collaborate if we are miles apart?</h3>
          <p class="answer">The internet is built for collaboration, we talk, use video, share screens, write in chat rooms and message. There is no need to be physically co-located anymore, many developers collaborate better when they aren't.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="question">How can I see what's happening? Won't I lose control?</h3>
          <p class="answer">In return for autonomy we require openness and availability. Everyday the whole team comes together online to share where they are, decide what's next, who they'll work with and help each other remove anything blocking the flow of work.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="question">I can't even find the developers I need, let alone trust them to work from home</h3>
          <p class="answer"> Somewhere in the country, continent, planet, is the person you dream of, offer them the ability to work this way and they'll bite your arm off to come and work for you, and share their expertise with your team... This takes staff liquidity to a new level.  </p>

          <h3 class="question">How does it feel?</h3>
          <blockquote class="answer" cite="http://diaryofascrummaster.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/what-does-collaborative-remote-software-development-feel-like/"> It feels great. After walking my daughter to school, I tend to log on around 9. Perhaps chat to a few people, maybe a quick code review or take a fresh look at yesterdays work in progress, before we all join the virtual standup around 9:25...<a href="http://diaryofascrummaster.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/what-does-collaborative-remote-software-development-feel-like/" target="_blank">More</a> </blockquote>

        <h2>So What's The Plan?</h2>
        <p>It depends on how you are working right now, but an example might be:
        <ol>
          <li><span class="tomato">2-day workshop:</span> Where are we? Can we work from home? What's stopping us? What's helping and hindering us? Is what we do visible? What do we need to learn? How can we learn more effectively? 
          <li><span class="tomato">Lets Get Started:</span> The team starts working from home with <span class="logo">LeanTomato</span> helping to get this new way of work established.
          <li><span class="tomato">Keep Improving:</span> We pop back form time to time to see how you are improving and offer help with any problems you are encountering.
        </ol>
