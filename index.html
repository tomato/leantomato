  <h2>Why Work From Home?</h2>
  <p class="important answer">Because you can take away the commute, the politics and the hierarchy, and leave the team to work together, focused on their purpose.

      <h3 class="question">How can the we collaborate if we are miles apart?</h3>
      <p class="answer">The internet is built for collaboration, we talk, use video, share screens, write in chat rooms and message. There is no need to be physically co-located anymore, many developers collaborate better when they aren't.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3 class="question">How can I see what's happening? Won't I lose control?</h3>
      <p class="answer">In return for autonomy we require openness and availability. Everyday the whole team comes together online to share where they are, decide what's next, who they'll work with and help each other remove anything blocking the flow of work.</p>

      <h3 class="question">I can't even find the developers I need, let alone trust them to work from home</h3>
      <p class="answer"> Somewhere in the country, continent, planet, is the person you dream of, offer them the ability to work this way and they'll bite your arm off to come and work for you, and share their expertise with your team... This takes staff liquidity to a new level.  </p>

      <h3 class="question">How does it feel?</h3>
      <blockquote class="answer" cite="/collaborative%20remote%20software%20development/2013/11/05/what-does-collaborative-remote-software-development-feel-like.html"> It feels great. After walking my daughter to school, I tend to log on around 9.

    <h2 id="training" >Training and Workshops</h2>
    <p>Are you working remotely and struggling to be a collaborative team, or a collaborative team wanting to work remotely? If so I can help establish effective ways of working by running remote workshops with your team from 1/2 to 2 days long. Theses workshops will help you overcome the lack of visibility and osmotic communication when you are remote, and explore the new opportunities for collaboration that remote working brings.</p>
    <h2 id="consulting" >Consulting</h2>
    If you are looking for help with setting up remote development teams or with a transition to remote work I'd be happy help.
    <h2 id="speaking" >Speaking</h2>
    <p>I'm happy to speak at events and local meetups about remote collaborative work or Agile Development. In 2013 I ran a workshop at  Scrum Gathering Paris (<a href="http://tomato.github.io/UsAndThem">slides here</a>)   and Lean Kanban UK (<a href="http://youtu.be/5fdqx6Dzm4s">video here</a>).</p>
