    <h2>We build elegant, usable web applications that simplify your business</h2>
    <p>
        Our bespoke web application development is driven by a dedication to intuitive, responsive,
        user interfaces and simple logic. Desktop or Mobile, SME or Corporate. We're currently working on
        a cloud based product that allows small management consultancies to track efficiencies and waste for
        their clients.
    </p>
    <h2>We build teams</h2>
    <p>
        Teams that burst with a desire to meet your needs. Diverse teams that stretch and inspire each other. We recruit the right team and set them off down a righteous path, loving quality, loathing waste.
    </p>
    <h2>We help you adopt an Agile and Lean mindset</h2>
    <p>
        Agile consulting/coaching/mentoring/workshops/anything else?
        After 8 years as a Scrummaster and a 100 blogs posts, Iâ€™m happy to share my failures and successes and help you find a path to a more effective way of working.
    </p>
    <h2>Remote Working</h2>
    <p>
        Are you working remotely and struggling to be a collaborative team, or a collaborative team wanting to
        work remotely? If so we can help establish effective ways of working by running remote workshops with your
        team from 1/2 to 2 days long.
    </p>
    <h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>
    <p>
        I'm happy to speak at events and local meetups about remote collaborative work or Agile Development.
        In 2013 I ran a workshop at  Scrum Gathering Paris (<a href="http://tomato.github.io/UsAndThem">slides here</a>)
        and Lean Kanban UK (<a href="http://youtu.be/5fdqx6Dzm4s">video here</a>).
